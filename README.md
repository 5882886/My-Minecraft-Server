# My-Minecraft-Sever

## What is it?

This repository stores my Minecraft project, including a simple spiogt plugin based on Minecraft 1.20.1, designed for the Minecraft Sever belonging to class "Zhisuan Eleven", Tianjin University, China; and a Minecraft 1.20.1 mod developed specifically for the Forge server.

Recently, I've made a simple PCL menu. If you like it, please copy the path and paste it on the PCL custom menu settings.

## Can I use it?

Actually, everyone can use them. However, in considerarion of the fact that they are customized for my own class, I strongly recommand that you should make some small adjustments to enjoy the best compatibility. If you have any suggestion, please do not hesitate to share!
